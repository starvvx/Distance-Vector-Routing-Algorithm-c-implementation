# Distance-Vector-Routing-Algorithm-c++-implementation
C++ code for Distance Vector Routing Algorithm in Computer Networks

A distance-vector routing (DVR) protocol requires that a router inform its neighbours of topology changes periodically. Historically known as the old ARPANET routing algorithm (or
known as Bellman-Ford algorithm).

This is a c++ code for the DVR Protocol.

Here i have created router class which holds the distance vector and intermediate node for each router. Then i created an array of routers which will contain all the routers 

To run this algorithm:

1. You have to enter all the connections in form of source and destination routers with the cost of route.
2. Once you have given the input, our algorithm will automatically generate the cost matrix.
3. Then the cost of routing for each router will be calculated.
